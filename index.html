          <h1>I. Grammar 1.2: The Noun (Continued)</h1>

          <h2>THE NOUN (Continued)</h2>
          <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

          <P>
            In Lesson One, we learned to recognize and to use different kinds of nouns: proper and common nouns, collective nouns, concrete and abstract nouns, and specific and non-specific nouns.
            <br>
            In this lesson, we will learn about <b>singular</b>, plural, and <b>possessive nouns</b>. But first, let us learn some new words.
          </P>

          <h2>OTHER WORDS TO LEARN</h2>

          <p>
            Look around you. Describe what you see. Are there two or more of the same item? If so, you will have to use plural nouns to describe them. Examples: books, lamps, desks, chairs, pencils, pens, boxes, pictures, clocks, waste baskets. Sentence: "There are three chairs and one desk in my office."
          </p>
          <p>
            A singular noun is a noun that names only one person, place, or thing.
            <br><br>
A plural noun is a noun that names more than one person, place, or thing.
          </p>

          <h2>How do you make a noun plural?</h2>
          <p>
            Most nouns can be made plural by simply adding "s." 
            <br>
Examples: bird--birds; flower-- flowers; tree--trees.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, nouns that end with "s," "sh," "ch," "x," or "z" are made plural by adding "es." <br>
Examples: glass--glasses; wish--wishes; church--churches; fox--foxes. Sentence: "The foxes have holes to live in, and the birds have nests to live in, but the Son of Man has no place where he can rest his head" (Luke 9:58).
          </p>

        <div class="col-md-6 py-3">
          <p>
            Also, nouns that end with an "o" preceded by a consonant are made plural by adding "es." 
Examples: mosquito--mosquitoes; potato--potatoes; hero--heroes. Sentence: "Idaho is famous for its potatoes."
<br><br>
Nouns that end with a consonant followed by a "y" are made plural by changing the "y" to "i" and adding "es." 
Examples: library--libraries; secretary--secretaries; baby--babies; city-- cities. Sentence: "Most cities have several good libraries."
<br><br>
However, when a noun ends with a vowel followed by a "y", it is made plural by simply adding "s." 
Examples: journey--journeys; key--keys; toy--toys. Sentence: "He has nine keys in his pocket."
<br><br>
Most nouns that end with "f" or "fe" are made plural by changing the ending to "ves." 
Example: knife--knives; leaf--leaves; wife--wives. Sentence: "She has twenty-three knives in her kitchen."

          <p>Example: "My brother caught six fish."</p>

          <h2>POSSESSIVE NOUNS</h2>

          <p>
            A <b>possessive noun</b> is a noun that indicates ownership or relationship. 
Examples: the boy's bicycle; the girl's doll; the man's strength; the woman's beauty.
<br><br>
Most singular nouns are made possessive by simply adding an apostrophe (') and an "s." 
Examples: child--child's; teacher--teacher's. Sentence: "This is the teacher's book."
<br><br>
The apostrophe is a helpful little tool. It is used 
(a) to show possession and relationship, 
(b) to take the place of a missing letter in a word, and 
(c) to form the plural of letters and numbers. 
Think how much more difficult the English language would be without it. Instead of saying "God's world," we would have to say "the world that belongs to God." 
Examples: "This is the carpenter's hammer." "The nation's honor must be respected." "That's right." "It's great to be alive!" "There are two a's in the word 'altar'."
<br><br>
Plural nouns that end in "s" or "es" are made possessive by adding an apostrophe (') to the end of the word. 
Examples: candles--candles'; daughters--daughters'; mothers--mothers'; ships-- ships'; teachers--teachers'. 
Sentence: "Are you going to the Mothers' and Daughters' dinner?"
<br><br>
Plural nouns that do not end with "s" are made possessive by adding an apostrophe (') and an "s" to the end of the word.
Examples: children--children's; men--men's; people--people's; women--women's. 
Sentence: "This store specializes in children's clothing."

          <h2>YOUR ASSIGNMENT</h2>
          <ol class="ml-3">
            <li>Answer the questions on Grammar Lesson 2.</li>
            <li>Then read Reading Assignment 2 and look for nouns. Count the nouns and notice how important nouns are to the English language. Without nouns, there would be no substance or content to our communication. We would not know who or what was being discussed or where the action was taking place.</li>
